I'm a postdoctoral researcher at Institut de Recherche en Informatique Fondamentale ([IRIF](https://www.irif.fr/index)), working under [Paul-André Melliès](https://www.irif.fr/~mellies/) as part of the [Malinca](https://malinca.gitlabpages.inria.fr/malinca.gitlab.io/index.html) project. I completed my PhD in mathematics at [Laboratoire Paul Painlevé](https://math.univ-lille.fr) in Lille, under the supervision of [Benoit Fresse](https://pro.univ-lille.fr/benoit-fresse).

## Research Interests 

*Operads, Category Theory, Iterated Loop Spaces, Iterated Monoidal Structures, Foundations of Mathematics*

My research lies at the interface of category theory, logic, and algebraic topology. The purpose of [my thesis](https://theses.hal.science/tel-04617115) was to construct cofibrant models of $$E_n$$-operads governing the structure of $$n$$-fold iterated monoidal categories. The internal reasoning developed in my thesis eventually led me to an internal approach to the formalisation of mathematical language, structured around the hierarchy of $$n$$-categories and supporting iterated internalisation. My current objective is to refine this language so that it is both conceptually clear to logicians and practically implementable as a proof assistant.
